# bibhtmlize

`bibhtmlize` is essentially a deviously hacked BibTeX style that generates HTML rather than TeX output, plus a couple little things to make it actually practical to use.

### Disclaimer
I shamelessly took ideas and stuff from [Bibhtml](http://nxg.me.uk/dist/bibhtml/) and from Nicolas Markey's [publist](http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/BibTeX/publist/), then tweaked a few things to match my bibliography bookkeeping conventions and metadata. I won't pretend it's flexible or useable by anyone else than me, but heyâ€¦ it's a start.
